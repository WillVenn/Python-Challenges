Python-Challenges
=================

A Tkinter python challenge program.

I have been given 30 different Python challenges from asking and 
displaying user input to file handling, I have decided to use 
Tkinter and Python3.x for this project as i need it to run 
cross-platform (Otherwise I would have used GTK)
